# Modernize the Website Design
**I will list here my suggestions to improve the design of this website, note that I wanted to implement the edits immediately but I realized that it will take a decent time.**

---
## Articles List
The style of this list is very basic and not readable.

I've made a card design as an article container, I would put each 3 cards in a row.
Check the codepen: https://codepen.io/adeebtwait/full/qBawdvx

## Header
I think it will be better if I made a dropdown under the username, which contains the settings and logout links.
The New Article button is in action related to the articles, it should not be in the header, it should be in where the articles exist.

## Cover
I would give this part more height, put a transparent picture as a background, and an expressive description of the website.

## Forms
The forms in this website are boring and very basic, I would import any popular frontend framework and use its forms design, because I don't need to re-invent the wheel here :).
